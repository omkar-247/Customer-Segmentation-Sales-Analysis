## SQL Queries for Data Analysis:

```sql
-- Total Sales by Region
SELECT Customer_Region, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales 
FROM customer_sales 
GROUP BY Customer_Region;

-- Top 5 Customers by Sales
SELECT Customer_ID, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales 
FROM customer_sales 
GROUP BY Customer_ID 
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Sales by Category
SELECT Category, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales 
FROM customer_sales 
GROUP BY Category;

-- Monthly Sales Trend
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM Order_Date) AS SalesMonth, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales 
FROM customer_sales 
GROUP BY SalesMonth;
